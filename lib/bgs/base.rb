  # also aware of the BGS's URL patterns, making it easy to define new
  # web services as needed using some light reflection.

    # -`forward_proxy_url`, if provided, will funnel all requests to the provided
    # url instead of directly to BGS, and add the destination hostname
    # in the HTTP headers under "Host".
    # -`log` will enable `savon` logging.
